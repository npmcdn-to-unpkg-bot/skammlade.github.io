Fort Collins, CO is home to a thriving grassroots racing scene. Your Group Ride hosts an annual time trial every Tuesday in April known as the [Horsetooth Time Trial Series](http://yourgroupride.com/index.php/local-races/horsetooth-time-trial-series). The hilly **14.35 mile** course runs along Horsetooth Reservoire and Horsetooth Mountain Park climbing a total of **1,336 feet**.

I wanted to see how the racer turnout compared between men versus women so I plotted race data from 2011-2015. Last year had the greatest turnout for female cyclsts so far with **34 racers** representing **21.25%** of total racers.

I thought it was strange that 2013 had such a low showing. I pulled some temperature data from [WeatherUnderground](https://www.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?query=pws:KCOFORTC71) for each date during the race time and found it was rideable weather for all of the races!

You can play around with the [race data][results] yourself (pulled from [YGR google docs][YGR drive]). *Note: the 2011 course differs from the 2012-2015 course and therefore times were omitted.
